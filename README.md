## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, React, Node, Express, Sanity, HTML, CSS 

## Optimizations

When I improve this project, I would add testimonials and completed projects/work. Currrently using Sanity.io  It comes with an open-source editing environment called Sanity Studio that  can customize with JavaScript, and a real-time hosted data store.  Sanity Studio will allow me to go in easily and update my data.

## Lessons Learned:

Seperation of Concerns. Realized how much easier it is to add ccontainers and schemas.
Sanity.io.  A change from using MongoDB.  I needed an environment where I can easily go in to change and update the content of my site.
